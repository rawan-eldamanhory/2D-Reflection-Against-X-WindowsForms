# 2D Reflection Against X-Axis (Windows Forms)

This project is a simple **Windows Forms application** that demonstrates the concept of **2D geometric reflection against the X-axis** using C# graphics.

## 🖼 Project Overview
The application draws a shape on the screen and then renders its reflection against the X-axis using basic geometric transformation principles.

## 📌 Concepts Covered
- 2D Reflection
- Coordinate transformation
- Drawing shapes using GDI+ (`Graphics`)
- Windows Forms rendering

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C#
- Windows Forms
- GDI+ Graphics

## ▶️ How It Works
1. A shape is defined using a set of 2D points.
2. The shape is drawn in its original position.
3. Reflection is applied by transforming the Y-coordinates.
4. The reflected shape is drawn using a different color.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `WindowsFormsApp1.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution
3. Run the application
4. Observe the original and reflected shapes

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding reflection in 2D space
- Applying transformations around a reference axis
- Using Windows Forms for graphical rendering
